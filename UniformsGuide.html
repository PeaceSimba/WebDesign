    <div class="uniform-div">
        <p>Simplicity is one of the distinguishing characteristics of a truly fine dancer. While we're working
        on the strength and technique needed to accomplish this goal, we can start by being simple in dress, which is why we have
        a uniform. As a conservatory level school of dance our dress code is an important part of our curriculum. Showing respect
        for our art in conduct as well as a dress code helps foster the required discipline it takes to learn a classical art. To
        assist you in preparing your dancer properly for classes following are specifics on our dress code

        <ul class="uniform-list">
    <li>Black leotard of any style. Simple designs are always the best.</li>
    <li>Bloch Salmon Tight either footed or convertible.
         Seams required for Student and Advanced Division for performances only.</li>
<li>Pink ballet slippers by Bloch. The shoes selected must match the color of the Bloch Salmon tights. Elastics MUST be sewn
on ballet slippers. The elastics are needed for safety - in an attempt to keep the shoes from falling off, the dancer will
unconsciously grip the ligaments of the foot, which can lead to strain and possible injury.</li>
        </ul>

<div class="bottom-uniformguide">

<li>Hair in a classical ballet bun. If you need bun making lessons just ask, we are happy to help. A proper bun secured tightly
to the head is important especially when turning in class. Hair that is falling out is disruptive to the learning process
and is also a safety hazard as pins fall to the floor.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<div  class="no-dangling block2-uniform">
    <ul class="uniform-list">
<li>NO DANGLING EARRINGS. This is a safety requirement. No rings, bracelets, or 
    necklaces. Please leave your jewelry at home.</li>

    </ul>

<div class="pointe block2-uniform">
    <ul class="uniform-list">
<li  >Pointe Shoes for beginner pointe dancers should NOT be purchased until they are given guidelines by the teacher. Elastics
and ribbons must be properly sewn to the pointe shoes once they are approved by the teacher. A tutorial on how to properly
sew pointe shoes will be given by NYAB staff as needed. NO STREET CLOTHES allowed in class. I understand the need for additional
clothing in the cold weather. If your dancer does not own a ballet sweater, NYAB has loaner sweaters in the girls dressing
room. Additionally, in the cold weather please keep all warm-up clothing to the colors of black and pink. Simple black and
pink exemplifies the conservatory level work in the studio at LBDC</li>
</ul>

<div class="uniform-right special-inline">
    <P class="special-note">*Special note for our Saturday Student Division and Advanced Division dancers. Saturday is an extra special day at LBDC so
